// lets talk about increment operator


// 1. its a prefix operator
let x = 4;
let y = ++x;

// console.log(y);
// console.log(x);

// 2.Postfix operator
let a = 5;

let b = a++;

console.log(b);
console.log(a);


// there is the same operator in js as decrement operator u can use -- to this operator

// Example : - 
// a-- this is post fix
// --a this is prefix 


// these are the docs created by
